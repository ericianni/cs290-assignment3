Tasks: Started looking over the assignment and getting my repo clone set up. 
I also began working on functions.js and finished most of it but my isNull 
isn't working correctly.

Tasks: I spent an hour trying to get parse to work. My function is UGLY as 
sin and I will likely revisit it. Took so long because I failed to examine 
the GitLog documentation and didn't realize I had to convert my string date 
into a Date()

Tasks: Started at 4:58 - Created an isUndefined function because test.js calls
it. Found out that I needed to add a condition to my if() in isNull/isUndefined.
Started working on objects.js. Finished returnObjectLiteral. MessageLog is 
completely written but test.js seems to be incorrect AGAIN! I am beyond frustrated 
so I am quitting for the night. Still no word from the instructor about the 
previously reported errors.

Tasks: Started at 6:30 - created a MessageLog for BlackHatGuy. The comments 
didn't specify a name for the variable. I had to look in test.js to find out 
it needed to be called myLog. Unsure how to do systemReceived(). It isn't 
specified in the test document so I am unsure how they want the function to be tested.

Tasks: Pulled down the master from the instructors website and merged with my master. 
Verified that the code still worked and pushed to my repo. Then relocated the object
literal outside the function.

Tasks: While helping another student with parseGit I decided I didn't like my brute 
force method and went in search of a better way. Found said better way on stackoverflow.com

Tasks: This commit was worked on over a few hours (4 hours total). This was
more trouble than it needed to be. I finally was able to access the
language element. Hopefully the rest will fall into place.

Tasks: Almost four hours and I have got the gists to load and I can
seclect favorites and they will show up on page load,but I am
about try to remove favorites and then filtering. Committing

Tasks: Been working since 8:30 this morning. I feel this commit is stable
and feature complete. I am now going to try to spruce it up a tad.

Tasks: I have now been working on this for 11 solid hours today. The page
is feature complete and looks mostly polished. The material did not
prepare me for this assignment. The amount of googling I had to do
was astronomical.

Tasks: About an hour changing some functionality. Originally thought the phrase
"filter out" meant remove the languages checked. Having read Canvas
I decided I was probaly wrong. Also changed the functionality of SEARCH
to better match Mr. Wilford's comments on Canvas. Code is commented and
I am not running through gjslint

Start: Sun, Feb 1 04:31:00 2015 -500
End: Sun, Feb 1 04:47:51 2015 -0500
Tasks: Was trying to get my code to pass gjslint without any errors but
I can't. All my @param say I am missing a type in the @param tag.
But when I change the thing following @param to anything other than
the parameter name in the function header it also gives me an error
saying it was expecting the name from the header.

Tasks: Fixed the issue with my CORS problem with the help of Mr. Wilford.
Noticed an error with loading the page with saved favorites and then unfavorting
and then favoriting again creating empty objects in fav_list saved locally.
Changed the approach of how I built the objects to add to fav_list.
