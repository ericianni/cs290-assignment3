Tasks: Started looking over the assignment and getting my repo clone set up. I also began working on functions.js and finished most of it but my isNull isn't working correctly.

Tasks: I spent an hour trying to get parse to work. My function is UGLY as sin and I will likely revisit it. Took so long because I failed to examine the GitLog documentation and didn't realize I had to convert my string date into a Date()

Tasks: Started at 4:58 - Created an isUndefined function because test.js calls it. Found out that I needed to add a condition to my if() in isNull/isUndefined. Started working on objects.js. Finished returnObjectLiteral. MessageLog is completely written but test.js seems to be incorrect AGAIN! I am beyond frustrated so I am quitting for the night. Still no word from the instructor about the previously reported errors.

Tasks: Started at 6:30 - created a MessageLog for BlackHatGuy. The comments didn't specify a name for the variable. I had to look in test.js to find out it needed to be called myLog. Unsure how to do systemReceived(). It isn't specified in the test document so I am unsure how they want the function to be tested.

Tasks: Pulled down the master from the instructors website and merged with my master. Verified that the code still worked and pushed to my repo. Then relocated the object literal outside the function.
